"The engine misfires during acceleration and fuel consumption has increased. The injection warning light turns on intermittently.",Fuel System Problems
"The fuel tank has a slow leak where the sending unit meets the tank. There's a persistent smell of fuel after parking and the ground shows wet spots.",Fuel System Problems
"The engine hesitates specifically during cold weather starts. The fuel line has condensation freezing in it and the winter-grade fuel is inappropriate for the temperature.",Fuel System Problems
"The crankshaft position sensor is providing intermittent signals. The engine stalls unpredictably and is difficult to restart when hot.",Ignition System Malfunctions
"When starting the engine, a screeching noise is heard from the front. The timing belt shows signs of wear and its tension appears insufficient.",Ignition System Malfunctions
"The car struggles to start and emits blue smoke from the exhaust when it runs. The spark plugs appear wet with oil when removed.",Ignition System Malfunctions
"The engine cooling system has been contaminated with stop-leak products. The radiator tubes are partially blocked and flow is restricted through the core.",Cooling System Anomalies
"The head gasket is leaking combustion gases into the cooling system. Bubbles are visible in the radiator and the oil has a milky appearance.",Cooling System Anomalies
"The engine overheats in traffic jams and the radiator fan runs continuously. Steam occasionally escapes from under the hood and the coolant reservoir is empty despite recent filling.",Cooling System Anomalies
"The ABS warning light stays on after starting the vehicle. One wheel locks up during heavy braking and there's an audible grinding noise from that wheel.",Brake System Defects
"The brake pedal vibrates violently during emergency stopping. The brake fluid has not been changed in years and air is present in the hydraulic system.",Brake System Defects
"The brake lines have visible rust and are leaking at connection points. The master cylinder reservoir level drops gradually even when the vehicle is not used.",Brake System Defects
"The automatic transmission fails to downshift when passing. The governor gear is stripped and the valve body passages are clogged with debris.",Transmission Problems
"The overdrive gear engages and disengages randomly during highway cruising. The overdrive solenoid has electrical issues and the speed sensor provides erratic signals.",Transmission Problems
"Gear shifts are rough and delayed, especially when cold. The transmission makes a whining noise at highway speeds and there's a red fluid leak under the vehicle.",Transmission Problems
"Power windows operate slowly and the radio cuts out occasionally. Several fuses have blown repeatedly and there's a burning smell from the dashboard.",Electrical/Electronic Failures
"The headlights dim when other electrical devices are turned on. The battery discharges after a few days of inactivity and the alternator emits a hissing sound.",Electrical/Electronic Failures
