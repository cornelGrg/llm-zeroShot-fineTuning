With very low vertical wind shear and incredibly warm sea-surface temperatures, Milton will be able to gain steady to rapid strength over the next few days.

After a very brief respite, the atmosphere will therefore return to agitation due to an unstable front which is already close to Italy, driven by a deep cyclonic circulation which has its driving center near the United Kingdom. It will be precisely this enormous container of strong instability that will influence the meteorological picture in Italy even during the week that has just begun.	weather
Italy is preparing to face a significant climatic dichotomy, with rather marked differences between the North and the South offering an almost "two seasons in one" scenario. Responsible for this peculiar weather-climatic picture will be a cyclonic vortex, with its driving center on the United Kingdom, which will also extend its influence to our latitudes. This will create an "accordion" effect on Italy: if on the one hand it will push masses of humid, fresh and unstable air towards the northern regions, at the same time it will activate warm Sirocco currents which will carry increasingly warmer air towards the South and part of the Center.	weather
